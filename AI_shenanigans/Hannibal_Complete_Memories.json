I wanted to thank you for being so good with all the boys.\"\nDETECTIVE PASCAL: \"Those boys were very brave.\"\nFREDDIE LOUNDS: \"They are good boys. You're a local police detective?\"\nDETECTIVE PASCAL: \"Yes, ma'am.\"\nFREDDIE LOUNDS: \"Would it be an imposition to ask a few things?

He's some kinda special consultant. Works with the F.B.I.\"\nFREDDIE LOUNDS: \"Huh. OFF Freddie's intrigue, BACK TO: ON WILL He takes a deep, calming breath, exhales, closes his eyes.  It swings in the darkness of Will's mind, keeping rhythm with his heart be at. FWUM.  FWUM.  All sound is muffled then buried beneath the ORGANIC HUM of his CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. ON A NEST-SHAPED MUSHROOM FWUM. FWUM. The FUNGUS SHRINKS in a stylistic device, REWINDING Will to a time before the last burial. FWUM. ON WILL His eyes are closed. FWUM.  FWUM.  The PENDULUM is now outside his head. It swings in front of Will and the EXHUMED GARDEN GRAVES are now a small field of BURLAP SACK COVERED ARMS -- save for ONE OPEN GRAVE. Next to the grave is the RADIO FLYER WAGON overflowing with moist, BLACK DIRT. FWUM. Will Graham opens his eyes and walks BACKWARDS toward the edge of the clearing and into the surrounding woods. FWUM.  FWUM. The PENDULUM STOPS SWINGING, snapping into place as Will snaps into a very clear FOCUS. AT THE POLICE LINE Freddie Lounds and Detective Pascal watch Will's seemingly strange process from behind the Crime Scene Tape. Detective Pascal notices that the Wildlife Explorers are being gathered up by their Parents and moved off. He indicates to Freddie, who has also caught the eye of Brian Zeller on the other side of the CRIME SCENE TAPE:\"\nDETECTIVE PASCAL: \"I think your family is leaving. Freddie can't take her eyes off Will Graham's peculiarities.\"\nFREDDIE LOUNDS: \"We drove separately. CLOSE ON A SHOVEL Will digs the shovel into the moist, black dirt. CAMERA POPS WIDE to reveal Will is now standing over a NAKED MAN lying on his back in a shallow open grave. Will speaks as he shoves an OXYGEN TUBE into the man's nose, then covers his eyes and mouth with DUCT-TAPED, then tethers his to a piece of REBAR, fixing the catheter in place.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"I choose this man. I do not bind his arm or legs as I bury him in a shallow grave. He is alive but will never be conscious again. Climbing out, Will shovels a load of compost from the wagon and holds it over the man, preparing to dump it on him. Will dumps the dirt into the grave, covering the man. Will turns away to get more dirt from the Radio Flyer wagon.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"He won't know he's dying. I don't need him to. This is my design. However, when Will turns back to the grave, he stops cold. CAMERA REVEALS WILL'S POV: GARRET JACOB HOBBS is now lying in the grave leering up at him. ALL SOUND ABRUPTLY DROPS OUT as Will stares, caught in a vacuum unable to breath. He squeezes his eyes shut, jagged breath threaten hyperventilation. Will focuses and finally opens his eyes, looking back into the open grave. There is NO GARRET JACOB HOBBS. Only a man's body covered in morbidly vibrant FUNGUS AND MOLDS. Will breaths a sigh of relief, relieved to be alone with the dead. Then SNATCH! The FUNGUS COVERED ARM GRABS Will by the wrist, a rattled, wet gasp signals a sharp in-take of air. HE'S STILL ALIVE! Terrified, Will SCREAMS in abjecthorror. AT THE POLICE LINE Freddie cranes her head over Detective Pascal's shoulder as Will's sudden scream draws everyone's attention. Freddie watches Crawford, Zeller, Price and Katz race toward Will.\"\nFREDDIE LOUNDS: \"Looks like you got a live one.\""

He'll just pick up the phone. Any more phone calls, Jack?\"\nJACK CRAWFORD: \"No. If this is the Ripper, there will be at least two more bodies, then nothing for months, maybe years. We'll have a window to catch him and then that window will close. The last time it closed, I lost the Ripper and I lost Miriam Lass.

It can generate any pitch throughout its range, even those between conventional notes.\"\nTOBIAS: \"So can a violin or a trombone.\"\nHANNIBAL: \"Are those your instruments?\"\nTOBIAS: \"The violin. Not the trombone.\"\nHANNIBAL: \"It seems we're both comfortable playing between conventional notes. Too bad you don't play the sliphorn. I hear the Orchestra is looking for a new trombonist.\"\nTOBIAS: \"Altogether horrible whathappened.\"\nHANNIBAL: \"Not altogether. It's an unfortunate way to leave the symphony, yes, but I can'thelp thinking the orchestra will be better for it.\"\nTOBIAS: \"At least the brass section.

Carlo finishes stuffing the effigy and ties off the last leg with string. Incongruously, he squirts the effigy with scent from a bottle of perfume.\"\nMASON VERGER: \"A pig is not like other animals. There is a spark ofintelligence and a terrible practicality in pigs. Mason nods at Carlo who hoists the effigy in his arms and walks past them, onto the roof of the maze, and attaches the effigy to an overhead hook.\"\nMARGOT VERGER: \"You have an unparalleled understanding of piggishness.\"\nMASON VERGER: \"Your mouth gets rough when you're scared, Margot. Tough as a livery pony who is resentful of the bit. Carlo is now using a winch to lower the effigy. Upright, it resembles a man much more. Meat oozing round the bindings. Carlo pulls a lever and there is a sudden rush of feet, and something huge enters the maze. Through the slats we can see glimpses of a herd of terrible SWINE. They SQUEAL in excitement and hurry toward the center.\"\nMASON VERGER: \"The structure is designed to excite and antagonize the pigs. Margot looks horrified.\"\nMASON VERGER: \"Taken awhile to find the perfect mix.  Any pig will eat a dead man, but to gethim to eat a live one, some education is required. Mason respectfully indicates Carlo.\"\nMASON VERGER: \"Carlo is experienced in this field and actually fed a man to pigs in Tuscany twenty years ago. Margot recognizes the clothes on the effigy.\"\nMARGOT VERGER: \"That's one of my suits.\"\nMASON VERGER: \"I'll buy you a new one. We stuff clothes with meat, scent it with human smells. Play screams every time they're fed. Come the real thing, we won't need the recording. Mason presses a button and Margot starts as the sound of SCREAMS plays on hidden speakers. Mason beams at her. Mason nods to Carlo and he starts lowering the meat-headed effigy toward the clamoring pigs.\"\nMASON VERGER: \"It's not just about making Papa proud.  It's about us. It's about family.  I want you to be proud of me too, Margot. You're all I have. And I'm all you have. The effigy starts shaking as its lower halfis torn apart. Margot is managing her horror. Mason grins at her:\"\nMASON VERGER: \"This little piggy went \"eee-eee- eee,\" all the way home. PUSH IN ON MARGOT. All we can hear is the LOUD FEEDING OF THE PIGS\""

DOLARHYDE'S WORKTABLE The pieces of an old FILM CAMERA lie disassembled on the table. Dolarhyde's hands carefully polish a lens with a silk cloth. We are back in his attic room. His breathing is slow and shallow as he works, utterly focused. And then: The NOISE comes again -- far louder than before. Dolarhyde's hands freeze. He looks up with a sharp intake of breath. The NOISE, harsh and guttural, comes a second time, LOUDER. Insistent.  Primordial. It seems to be reverberating through the house, coming from many places at once. Seemingly filling his head and the house at the same time. Dolarhyde waits, his eyes wide with fear and anticipation. Slowly, his gaze turns to something in the far corner. We go into his POV to see: GRANDMOTHER'S DENTURES Snaggletoothed and yellowed. An old lady's dentures, resting in a dry glass, the water long since evaporated. PUSH IN on those dentures which VIBRATE ever so slightly, RATTLING in the glass as the NOISE comes again, building now, as if it is coming from the dentures themselves. And as it approaches a ROAR Meld the NOISE with a different BUZZING ROAR and -- A BLUR The tattoo needle is PULSING in and out of skin.

Chilton is frightened as he\nspeaks, taking pains to stick to the Dragon's script:\nDR. CHILTON: \"I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Great Red Dragon. I lied about Him. All that was said was lies from Will Graham. He made me say them. I have blasphemed against the Dragon. Even so, the Dragon is merciful. He knows you made me lie, Will Graham.  Because I was forced to lie, He will be more merciful to me than to you, Will Graham. Chilton pauses and then continues. The group watches in horrified silence. Will's pulse pounds in his ears. He glances at Jack and Alana -- both, for a brief horrifying moment, have mirror shards in their bleeding eyes. A blink, and they're normal.\"\nDR. CHILTON: \"Reach behind you, Will Graham, and feel for the small knobs on the top of your pelvis. Feel your spine between them; that is the precise spot where the Dragon will snap your spine. There's much for you to dread. From my own lips, you'll learn a little more to dread. The video image clips as the camera is paused, and then starts recording again. Dolarhyde's muscular back, with the Great Red Dragon emblazoned across it, looms INTO FRAME and Chilton begins screaming horribly.\"\nALANA BLOOM: \"Turn it off, Jack. Alana looks away. Will slides down the wall to his haunches, head down. Over this, we hear: HANNIBAL\"\nDR. CHILTON: \"No'o,'ou'romised'ou'romised.
