               His eyes are closed. The PENDULUM is now outside his head.           
               It swings behind Will, wiping away in its wake the gush of           
               arterial spray from the wall. FWUM.  The PENDULUM swings on          
               the other side of the window, wiping away the OFFICERS and           
               POLICE CARS in front of the house. FWUM. The PENDULUM                
               swings across the stained carpet lifting the blood. FWUM.

               intentionally avoid looking at Will Graham backwards walking         
               through them toward the shadowy yard across the street.              
                                                                                    
               A Police Officer breaks protocol and sneaks a peek at Will.          
               A SUPERIOR OFFICER snaps and points at the Officer, who              
               quickly fixes his gaze on the ground in front of his feet.

               The street is empty. The PENDULUM STOPS SWINGING, snapping           
               into place as Will snaps into focus. He watches the quiet            
               house (he just back-walked out of) from across the street.           
               Through the partially curtained windows, he can see the              
               silhouettes of (still living) Theresa and Thomas Marlow.             
                                                                                    
               Will watches them for a long moment, taking in their                 
               domesticity, then walks with purpose for the front door.

               HOME SECURITY ALARM BLARES. Thomas Marlow rushes down the            
               stairs, two steps at a time, moving to intercept Will.               
                                                                                    
               Will raises a TOWEL-WRAPPED ARM. Thomas realizes too late            
               that it’s concealing a GUN. Will SHOOTS HIM TWICE THROUGH

               Theresa Marlow is frantically pushing the panic code into the        
               HOME SECURITY KEY PAD when Will SHOOTS HER expertly THROUGH          
               THE THROAT, missing her jugular, BREAKING HER NECK and               
               peppering the KEY BAD with blood. She drops to the floor.

                         through the neck. This is not a                            
                         fatal wound. The bullet misses                             
                         every artery. She is paralyzed                             
                         before it leaves her body. Which                           
                         doesn’t mean she can’t feel pain.                          
                         It just means she can’t do anything                        
                         about it. This is my design.

                         We’ve met.                                                 
               Jack knows full well they’ve met but didn’t intend to broach.

                         Yes, we had a disagreement about                           
                         the museum when we opened it.                              
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         I disagreed with what you named it.

                         The Evil Minds Research Museum?                            
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         It’s a little hammy, Jack.                                 
                                                                                    
               Jack likes Will’s directness and returns the favor:                  
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         You’ve hitched your horse to a                             
                         teaching post. I understand it’s                           
                         not easy for you to be sociable.                           
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         I’m just talking at them. I’m not                          
                         listening to them. It’s not social.                        
               Jack gently pushes Will’s glasses up the bridge of his nose          
               so he’s forced to make fleeting eye contact.                         
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         Where do you fall on the spectrum?                         
                                                                                    
               Will picks up the rhythm and syntax of Jack’s voice:                 
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         My horse is hitched to a post                              
                         closer to Aspergers and Autistics                          
                         than narcissists and sociopaths.                           
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         But you can empathize with                                 
                         narcissists and sociopaths.                                
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         I can empathize with anybody. Less                         
                         to do with personality disorders                           
                         than an active imagination.                                
                                                                                    
               Jack smiles at that, leans in, then:

                         I thought there were seven.

                         There were.

                         About three minutes before I walked                        
                         into your lecture hall.

                         You’re calling them “abductions”                           
                         because you have no bodies?

                         We have nothing. No bodies.  No                            
                         parts of bodies. Nothing that                              
                         comes out of a body. We have                               
                         lonely swabs in used evidence kits.

                         That’s not really true, is it? You

                         The evidence explains.

                         Then help me find some evidence.

               Elise’s PARENTS. They are sick with worry. Mr. Nichols is            
               rationalizing while Mrs. Nichols seems almost resigned.              
                                                                                    
                                   MR.  NICHOLS                                     
                         She could have gone off by herself.                        
                         She was a very interior young                              
                         woman.  She didn’t like living in a                        
                         dorm.  I could see how the pressure                        
                         of school might have gotten to her.                        
                         She likes trains. Maybe she just                           
                         got on a train and...                                      
               Will Graham and Jack Crawford sit opposite Mr. and Mrs.              
               Nichols as he trails off. Hard to convince even himself.             
               Will continues to avoid eye contact with the Nichols.                
                                                                                    
                                   MRS. NICHOLS                                     
                         She looks like the other girls.

                         She fits the profile.

                         Could Elise still be alive?

                         We simply have no way of knowing.                          
                                                                                    
               A previously silent Will Graham offers an odd question:

                         How’s the cat?

                         What?                                                      
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         How’s your cat? Elise was supposed                         
                         to feed it. Was the cat weird when                         
                         you came home? It didn’t eat all                           
                         weekend. Must have been hungry.                            
               The Nichols are initially unsure how to respond, then:

                         I didn’t notice.

                         He took her from here.                                     
                             (off Jack’s look)                                      
                         She got on a train. She came home.                         
                         She fed the cat. And he took her.

                         I’ll get that. Mr. Nichols, would                          
                         you put your hands in your pockets

                         You can hold the cat if it’s easier.                       
                                                                                    
               Mr. Nichols picks up the cat as instructed. Will wraps a             
               gloved hand around the knob and opens the door.

               The light from the hallway streaks across the floor and up           
               the wall as Will ENTERS. He stands just inside the door,             
               immediately noticing the OPEN WINDOW. He flicks on the light         
               switch, illuminating the room. He stares.

               She lays coffin-style in her bed, dressed in pajamas as if           
               she had JUST gone to sleep. The gray pallor of her skin, the         
               clean PUNCTURE WOUNDS visible under her pajamas, and her un-         
               breathing bosom are immediately evident to Will. Sadly, Mr.          
               Nichols fails to notice. Blinded by hope, he steps forward.

               Will nods. Jack stands and EXITS FRAME.                              
               REFLECTIVE LIGHT flashes across Will’s face, lighting up his         
               eyes.  All SOUND IS DULLED as if his ears were blocked, the          
               AMBIENT NOISE of Will’s circulatory system provides an

               Will scoops up water in his hands from the faucet in the sink        
               to wash down the last two Aspirin from his now empty bottle.         
               He splashes water on his face, dries it with his shirttail.

               Will Graham has climbed out the window onto the porch roof.          
               He sits on the gritty shingles. He hugs his knees, his damp          
               shirt pressed cold across his back. He snorts the night air          
               to cleanse the smell of Elise Nichols death from his nose.           
               From his vantage point, he can see POLICE OFFICERS, POLICE           
               CARS and other CRIME SCENE SPECIALISTS assembled on the lawn.        
               Mr. and Mrs. Nichols are treated in the back of an Ambulance.        
                                                                                    
               Will Graham takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

               It swings in the darkness of Will Graham’s mind, keeping             
               rhythm with his heart beat. FWUM.  FWUM.

               He OPENS HIS EYES and he is standing outside Elise Nichols’          
               Bedroom Window. The neighborhood is quiet and empty. No              
               Police.  No Police Cars. No Ambulance.                               
                                                                                    
               He looks through the window glass to Elise Nichols sleeping          
               soundly in her bed. Will quietly opens the window.

               Will stands over Elise Nichols, very much alive. He watches          
               her for a quiet moment. Tears well in Will’s eyes, then...           
               Will bears down on Elise’s chest with his knee, cracking ribs        
               as he simultaneously squeezes her throat shut with his hands.        
               It’s sudden and horrible and violent. Elise is immediately           
               startled out of a deep sleep into terror.                            
                                                                                    
               Elise struggles, her face swelling with pressure, capillaries        
               in her skin and the whites of her eye WRINKLE and BURST.             
               Tears stream down her cheeks as she tries to scream but              
               cannot.  The bed board finally SNAPS and with it, Elise dies.
