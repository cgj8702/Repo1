FWUM.  FWUM. The PENDULUM STOPS SWINGING, snapping into place as Will snaps into a very clear FOCUS. AT THE POLICE LINE Freddie Lounds and Detective Pascal watch Will's seemingly strange process from behind the Crime Scene Tape. Detective Pascal notices that the Wildlife Explorers are being gathered up by their Parents and moved off. He indicates to Freddie, who has also caught the eye of Brian Zeller on the other side of the CRIME SCENE TAPE:\"\nDETECTIVE PASCAL: \"I think your family is leaving. Freddie can't take her eyes off Will Graham's peculiarities.\"\nFREDDIE LOUNDS: \"We drove separately. CLOSE ON A SHOVEL Will digs the shovel into the moist, black dirt.

Will speaks as he shoves an OXYGEN TUBE into the man's nose, then covers his eyes and mouth with DUCT-TAPED, then tethers his to a piece of REBAR, fixing the catheter in place.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"I choose this man. I do not bind his arm or legs as I bury him in a shallow grave. He is alive but will never be conscious again. Climbing out, Will shovels a load of compost from the wagon and holds it over the man, preparing to dump it on him. Will dumps the dirt into the grave, covering the man. Will turns away to get more dirt from the Radio Flyer wagon.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"He won't know he's dying. I don't need him to. This is my design. However, when Will turns back to the grave, he stops cold. CAMERA REVEALS WILL'S POV: GARRET JACOB HOBBS is now lying in the grave leering up at him. ALL SOUND ABRUPTLY DROPS OUT as Will stares, caught in a vacuum unable to breath. He squeezes his eyes shut, jagged breath threaten hyperventilation. Will focuses and finally opens his eyes, looking back into the open grave. There is NO GARRET JACOB HOBBS. Only a man's body covered in morbidly vibrant FUNGUS AND MOLDS. Will breaths a sigh of relief, relieved to be alone with the dead. Then SNATCH! The FUNGUS COVERED ARM GRABS Will by the wrist, a rattled, wet gasp signals a sharp in-take of air. HE'S STILL ALIVE! Terrified, Will SCREAMS in abjecthorror. AT THE POLICE LINE Freddie cranes her head over Detective Pascal's shoulder as Will's sudden scream draws everyone's attention. Freddie watches Crawford, Zeller, Price and Katz race toward Will.\"\nFREDDIE LOUNDS: \"Looks like you got a live one.\""

At the other end of the Hallway --\nThe STAIRWELL DOOR suddenly OPENS, and a winded Will Graham\nrushes out. Eldon startles, moves.  Will raises his gun and\nSHOOTS.  BLAM!\nThe bullet takes out a piece of Eldon Stammets shoulder,\nviolently propelling him backwards, his gun clattering to the\nfloor as he reached for it. Will pulls Abigail's gurney into\nthe hall, moving in on Eldon, kicking his gun out of reach.\nWill looks down at Eldon, who is in a state of shock.\nWILL GRAHAM: \"What were you going to do with her?\"\nELDON STAMMETS: \"We evolved from mycelium. Only reintroducing her to the concept.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"By burying her alive?\"\nELDON STAMMETS: \"Opisthokontum. A super kingdom of animalia and fungi together. That journalist said you understood me.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"I don't.\"\nELDON STAMMETS: \"You would have. Walk into a field of mycelium, they know you're there. Their spores reach for you when you pass by. I know who you're reaching for. You should have let me planther. You would have found her in a field where she could finally reach back. Will stares at Eldon a moment as the CLAMOR of approaching footsteps, no doubt investigating gunfire, approach, then:\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"You should know I'm a terrible shot.  I was trying to kill you. He taps the EMERGENCY STOP BUTTON and leans in the doorway as a BUSTLE OF COPS, NURSES and PARAMEDICS approach.\"\nHANNIBAL'S VOICE: \"When you shot Eldon Stammets who was it that you saw?\""
