The PENDULUM is now outside his head. It swings in front of Will and the EXHUMED GARDEN GRAVES are now a small field of BURLAP SACK COVERED ARMS -- save for ONE OPEN GRAVE. Next to the grave is the RADIO FLYER WAGON overflowing with moist, BLACK DIRT. FWUM. Will Graham opens his eyes and walks BACKWARDS toward the edge of the clearing and into the surrounding woods. FWUM.  FWUM. The PENDULUM STOPS SWINGING, snapping into place as Will snaps into a very clear FOCUS.

Detective Pascal notices that the Wildlife Explorers are being gathered up by their Parents and moved off. HANNIBAL - AIR #102 - Final Shooting Script 3/25/13 18.

He squeezes his eyes shut, jagged breath threaten hyperventilation. Will focuses and finally opens his eyes, looking back into the open grave. There is NO GARRET JACOB HOBBS. Only a man's body covered in morbidly vibrant FUNGUS AND MOLDS. Will breaths a sigh of relief, relieved to be alone with the dead. Then SNATCH! The FUNGUS COVERED ARM GRABS Will by the wrist, a rattled, wet gasp signals a sharp in-take of air. HE'S STILL ALIVE! Terrified, Will SCREAMS in abject horror.
