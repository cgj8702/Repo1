We all are.  Didn't you know?  But these aren't. She holds up a vial of a pearly, cloudy fluid. Mason produces his pistol. Margot sees it and moves first. Crashing into Mason as he fires. BLAM!

SHOT ENTIRELY FROM UNDER THE WATER, LOOKING UP: IMPRESSIONISTIC SHOTS as Margot and Mason fight. His good arm pinning her under the water. His body is dead weight againsther. CLOSE ON her swirling hair, their SILENT SCREAMS. Alana joins Margot wrestling Mason. EEL'S POV As the two HUMAN FACES plunge down into the water. Mason's face sending blood out like a mist. ON ALANA as she rushes to help Margot. Grabbing at Mason. CLOSE ON MARGOT -- as she comes out of the water with a GREAT GASP.  She holds Alana's gaze and they bear down with relentless force. Mason's hands claw at their hair. The two women hold him down. Cordell's transplanted face undulates in the water, blood flowing from beneath it. The eel agitates with in its lair. Alana's eyes lock with Margot's. SLAM -- the eel comes up and bites at the bloody wounds holding Cordell's face to Mason's Mason SCREAMS and swallows water as the eel tears at Cordell's face. As it comes free, the eel thrusts itself beyond, into Mason's open mouth, seeking softer meat. MOVE OFF THIS to find -- Cordell's bitten and torn face -- backlit -- as it slowly sinks to the bottom of the tank. ON ALANA -- still holding Mason's good hand. She reaches into a pocket and pulls out the HANK OF HANNIBAL'S HAIR. Presses it into Mason's palm\""
