Furtive glances around the room at that admission.\"\nJACK CRAWFORD: \"You lefthim in that field to die?\"\nKATHERINE PIMMS: \"I broughthim to that field to die. But I didn't kill him. Just quieted his mind so he could die in peace.\"\nJACK CRAWFORD: \"And Mr. Roat? Quiethis mind, too?\"\nKATHERINE PIMMS: \"Oh, yes. He suffered from crippling arthritis. After he was quieted, I saw him walk pain-free for the very first time. I watched him wander off and I knew I knew then that this moment now, here with you, was inevitable. I was good as caught.\"\nJACK CRAWFORD: \"You wanted to be caught.\"\nKATHERINE PIMMS: \"I wanted people to know I can help. I can't make the pain go away, but I can make it so it doesn't matter.\"\nJACK CRAWFORD: \"You can'thelp anyone anymore. Not like this. Not where you're going.\"\nKATHERINE PIMMS: \"I bet I can. You think I'm wrong. You stand there and intellectualize another person's pain of being alive relative to your own. If you can imagine yourself surviving that pain, you can imagine them. But we are not created equal, are we? I've protected these people from hopelessness. And that's beautiful.\"\nJACK CRAWFORD: \"These people? The door OPENS and Jack ENTERS the beautiful floral environment, overgrown and borderline unkempt. Jars of honey refract the harsh sunlight into amber beams of warmth. Scattered BEES flit from flower to flower, gathering pollen. Something moves, concealed in the plant life ahead. ON JACK CRAWFORD He trains his weapon on the movement. Then something else moves.  He swings around to see a BALD MAN with his head down.  Then a WOMAN, her hair matted to her face. All of a sudden, A MAN WITH a SHOCK OF HAIR is standing very near Jack, his eye sockets dripping honey. Jack lowers his weapon. It's clear none of these lobotomized people mean anyone any harm. Jack Crawford, horrified by what he's found, turns to Katherine Pimms standing in the doorway behind him, flanked by Zeller and Price, both dumbstruck by what they see.\"\nKATHERINE PIMMS: \"They were suffering. Is it so wrong to want to end that for them?\""
