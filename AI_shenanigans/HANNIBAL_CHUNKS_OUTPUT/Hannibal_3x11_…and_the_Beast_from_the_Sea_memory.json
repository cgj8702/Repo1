Each ROAR a question and an insult. DOLARHYDE'S POV The flash of a great red wing. A flick of the tail and Dolarhyde is suddenly thrown across the room. Another flick, but this time we see that Dolarhyde is attacking himself -- Fight Club style. He tears at his own body and, in his MIND'S EYE, we see chunks of flesh ripped from his back, landing in small slabs on the wood flood. INTERCUT between Dolarhyde's POV, as the Dragon attacks him, and an OMNISCIENT POV, as we see Dolarhyde attacking himself the ROARING growing louder and louder. Finally, even pleading, Dolarhyde is calm, exhausted:\"",
