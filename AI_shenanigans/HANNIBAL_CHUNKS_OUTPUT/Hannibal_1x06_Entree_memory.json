The effect I was hoping for was her death. Elevated to my art.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"You ate a tube of rheumatoid arthritis ointment for your art.\"\nDR. GIDEON: \"Had to look ill. The capsaicin in the salve irritated my stomach lining so I would sweat profusely.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"Brutalization of the body was done posthumously. The Chesapeake Ripper usually does that sort of thing during, not after.\"\nDR. GIDEON: \"I don't need to convince you I'm the Chesapeake Ripper.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"Seems that's what you need to do.
