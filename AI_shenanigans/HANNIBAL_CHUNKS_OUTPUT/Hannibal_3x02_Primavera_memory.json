One has an eye, one a mouth, another a stubbled jaw.  Then TIME REVERSES in EXTREME SLOW MOTION as the pieces draw together forming, not a teacup, but: WILL GRAHAM. He floats off the floor that shattered him, again whole, rising up off of the glistening red surface of the coagulated blood pool as CAMERA leads him into the air.

In the\ndistance ahead, Will hears unhurried footsteps.\nWILL GRAHAM: \"The unhurried footsteps stop as Will's shout echoes along the passageways. No reply.  A moment, then the footsteps resume their march. Will arrives at a fork in the corridors and he considers his choices. Footfalls come deep from with in the darkness; someone is there.  Will runs after them, dogged, into the black. A moment behind him -- PAZZI Arrives at the head of the walkway. He draws his gun and pauses for only a second before he follows Will. As the black swallows him as well WILL Pausing at a JUNCTION in the subterranean maze. It widens to include a SERIES OF PILLARS, adorned with MUMMIFIED CORPSES, surrounded by passages branching offin different directions. The clatter of footsteps changes. Due to the shape of the gallery and the conducting power of the walls, the sound RICOCHETS, seemingly coming from both directions Another be at and Will looks to his rear, realizing it's no trick of sound -- someone is behind him as well PAZZI Continues his pursuit as quickly as the darkness allows. His breathing is heavy and his gun leads him like a dowsing rod, his finger on the trigger. PAZZI Hears only his own footsteps as he arrives at -- THE JUNCTION The same one Will Graham encountered. Pazzi slows, taking in Will mighthave taken. He pivots, the seasoned cop, but there are too many blind spots. Too many angles to cover.\"\nINSPECTOR PAZZI: \"Signor Graham Suddenly -- A POV Approaches from behind Pazzi; the inspector is spun around. WILL GRAHAM Calm, quiet, yet unnerved.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"You shouldn't be down here alone.\"\nINSPECTOR PAZZI: \"I'm not alone. I'm with you.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"You don't know whose side I'm on. Pazzi stares at Will, cautious.\"\nINSPECTOR PAZZI: \"What are you going to do when you find him? Your il Mostro?\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"I'm curious about that myself.\"\nINSPECTOR PAZZI: \"You and I carry the dead with us, Signor Graham. We both need to unburden. There's no arguing the point.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"Why don't you carry your dead back to the chapel before you count yourself among them. Will drifts away from CAMERA\"\nINSPECTOR PAZZI: \"You're already dead, aren't you? disappearing in the dark.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"Buonanotte, commendatore. PAZZI He stands there in the dark, alone. Listening. He has not slipped away. Still and silent as the stone itself, he waits like a spider for Pazzi to come his direction. ON PAZZI He takes a last look in the darkness where Will disappeared, and he starts back toward the tunnel entrance. CAMERA finds Will. He moves deeper into the catacombs. CAMERA PULLS BACK, Will pushes forward WILL'S POV His imagination has flooded the catacombs in blood-red water. Treading deeper into the tunnels, propelled by guilt. No one materializes and Will moves on nevertheless ON WILL No intermittent bulbs light the passage. The frame of the corridor is lost to near utter darkness. Will pauses again.\"\nWILL GRAHAM: \"I forgive you. His voice RINGS down the depthless inky black. HANNIBAL Stands, hiding among the mummified corpses. He hears the plaintive offering -- and the echo that answers it -- but he says nothing in reply. entirely by the shadows.
