He floats off the floor that shattered him, again whole, rising up off of the glistening red surface of the coagulated blood pool as CAMERA leads him into the air.

As the shape rises, it becomes apparent it is not rising at all -- the blood is receding around it. The blood continues to recede, revealing Abigail Hobbs's face now she is surrounded by darkness. The blood retracts into her cut throat as she RISES IN A REVERSE COLLAPSE, gushes of fluid REVERSE RAINING through the air as they track with her.

The surface is dappled with drops of blood falling from above.  INT. NORMAN CHAPEL - NIGHT CAMERA prowls the church until it reveals: A HORRIFIC TABLEAU In the center of the chapel's floor, constructed directly above the inlaid skeleton. At first glimpse, it appears to be A HUGE HUMAN HEART.  But a second look reveals it's A MAN'S BODY, SKINNED -- limbs and back broken and folded to create the anatomical parts and chambers of the organ. The victim's head, hands and feet are missing, stumps portraying the muscle's severed vessels. The faux organ hovers above the floor, supported by a makeshift tripod formed by a TRIO OF SWORDS run through the body.  Down each blade, blood trickles. A bloody valentine awaiting its intended. It is drawn tight, its surface bearing a large SILHOUETTE OF A HUMAN HEART. A breeze ripples the fabric and, for a moment, the heart shadow appears to be beating. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal INT.
