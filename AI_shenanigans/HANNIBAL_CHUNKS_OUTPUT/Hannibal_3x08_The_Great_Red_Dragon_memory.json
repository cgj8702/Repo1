Dread and awful curiosity in his eyes DOLARHYDE'S HAND Resting on the Formica table in the break room. An echo of the opening shot of his hand. HANNIBAL But now he's slowly opening and closing his hand, as if feeling new sensations. Sensing untapped power. REVERSE TO DOLARHYDE'S FACE As he regards his own hand with fear and awe Isolated from the DIM MURMUR of work conversations in the background. DOLARHYDE'S WORKTABLE The pieces of an old FILM CAMERA lie disassembled on the table. Dolarhyde's hands carefully polish a lens with a silk cloth. We are back in his attic room. His breathing is slow and shallow as he works, utterly focused. And then: The NOISE comes again -- far louder than before. Dolarhyde's hands freeze. He looks up with a sharp intake of breath. The NOISE, harsh and guttural, comes a second time, LOUDER. Insistent.  Primordial. It seems to be reverberating through the house, coming from many places at once. Seemingly filling his head and the house at the same time. Dolarhyde waits, his eyes wide with fear and anticipation. Slowly, his gaze turns to something in the far corner. We go into his POV to see: GRANDMOTHER'S DENTURES Snaggletoothed and yellowed. An old lady's dentures, resting in a dry glass, the water long since evaporated. PUSH IN on those dentures which VIBRATE ever so slightly, RATTLING in the glass as the NOISE comes again, building now, as if it is coming from the dentures themselves. And as it approaches a ROAR Meld the NOISE with a different BUZZING ROAR and -- A BLUR The tattoo needle is PULSING in and out of skin. Reds and blacks form into shading, a picture taking form HANNIBAL INT. HONG KONG SHOP - NIGHT A Chinese DENTIST places a box on a glass counter. He opens it and pulls out the contents. Places them on the glass with a CLINK.  Looks toward CAMERA for approval. CLOSE -- the light from the display cabinets shines through a set of NEW DENTURES, perfect oversized replicas of Grandmother's teeth. Reveal now that Dolarhyde is the client. Looking at the dentures with awe, a trace of fear As he reaches for them, PRE-LAP the tattoo needle's ROAR. THE TATTOO ARTIST A Chinese man, intensely focused as he applies the tattoo. This, too, is in Hong Kong. THE TATTOO NEEDLE Filling the screen, its noise hurting our ears the current section of art in SHARP FOCUS, the whole fading beyond our plane of focus EXT. TREE - DAY Abrupt, jarring silence. The sound of the needle gone. Sudden bright sunlight cutting through foliage. A BUCK KNIFE BLADE Picks at the tree, peeling bark and whittling a shape. As we watch, it becomes the Chinese symbol for the RED DRAGON. ON DOLARHYDE Intent as he carves the symbol. He is high up in the tree. He smiles -- and then a noise off-screen makes him turn. We hear the LAUGHTER OF CHILDREN INT. DOLARHYDE'S HOUSE - ATTIC - DAY Dolarhyde as he stands before -- A NEW MIRROR. This one unbroken. He wears a silk kimono which he lets fall to the ground. We SLOWLY PULL WIDE and we reveal -- HANNIBAL THE MAJESTIC TATTOO Filling his back and thighs -- THE GREAT RED DRAGON made flesh.  It moves, flexing seemingly alive as his muscles bunch and roll HANNIBAL INT. NORMAN CHAPEL - DAY HANNIBAL LECTER sits in a pew, eyes lowered. Silence. Tiny sounds echo in the grand space. Around and behind him sit OLD ITALIAN WOMEN, all wearing dark scarves, faces in THE ALTAR Which is immediately bathed in light, as if triggered by A LONE DIVA Who begins singing a choral version of \"Vide Cor Meum.\" for him.  He is utterly in control of his environment. CLOSE ON the diva's lips as she sings. EXT.

FREEZE ON THE IMAGE Which turns into A LURID NEW YORK POST COVER Screaming tabloid headline: \"HANNIBAL THE CANNIBAL.\" INT. NORMAN CHAPEL - DAY ON HANNIBAL, music sweeping around him. Ready for the next movement in his personal concert. He calmly looks upward. HANNIBAL'S POV The fresco in the ceiling. Illuminated now. HANNIBAL And, as if under the intensity of his gaze, CRACKS appear in the stonework, which multiply and spread ON HANNIBAL'S FACE Observing with a smile of peaceful amusement.

He stands still as they comb him for evidence.  Legs shackled. Hands chained to the table. It is a visual echo of the Ep. #113 image of Will Graham being processed. Same room.  Same background. A TattleCrime headline washes across: \"KITCHEN NIGHTMARE.\" INT. NORMAN CHAPEL - DAY CLOSE ON HANNIBAL'S HANDS Unchained, they move with the music -- conducting it. Above him, cracks in the ceiling fresco spread. The diva's singing is joined by the GROANING of the building A CHUNK OF MASONRY starts falling behind him in SLO-MO, then another, as the chapel starts to collapse. Chunks of rubble falling toward the old Italian women. HANNIBAL We sense them around him more than we feature them. SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION tell us what we need to know INT. BSHCI - CORRIDOR - DAY He is in BSHCI overalls, shackled at wrists and ankles. A magazine interview with Dr. Chilton washes through: \"There is no name for what this man is. He may not even be a man.\" INT. NORMAN CHAPEL - DAY ON HANNIBAL, the ceiling fragments in mid-fall all around him now, as we hear the chapel TEARING ITSELF APART. He glances subtly at the old Italian women about to be pulverized by the falling rubble. The faintest smile crosses his face. Still the music plays, now a soundtrack to destruction, SOARING TO NEW HEIGHTS just as HANNIBAL'S FACE Stoic.  Expressionless. PULL OUT from that image. INT. BSHCI - HANNIBAL LECTER'S CELL - DAY And we pass through steel bars, then a nylon net, to reveal monastic.  White. Nothing personal with in it.

Next to him, a film projector throws light through celluloid, CLICKING rapidly as reels spin. That NOISE comes in again. The same one he heard in the Teaser.  A LOW GROWL that seems to come from everywhere at once.  Dolarhyde looks around, alarmed. He takes the needle off the record and the music stops.

The NOISE comes from the darkness, low and intimate now. Dolarhyde flinches. The NOISE comes again, louder and threatening. Overwhelmed, Dolarhyde closes his eyes tight, claps his hands over his ears as if to deny the beast. Then, slowly, he removes his hands and opens his eyes. Deep inside his skull, a LIGHT begins to grow and flicker deep beneath the surface; a warm illuminating glow.

He begins carefully folding the article in precise creases and sets about tearing it free. ON HANNIBAL as he begins to clip an article FRANCIS DOLARHYDE As he clips the same article, his scissors moving. We ON A GREAT LEDGER At least a hundred years old, bound in black leather with brass corners, on a sturdy table, centered beneath a painting of Blake's The Great Red Dragon. DOLARHYDE He settles into a chair and opens the ledger. Across the first page, in large letters, are the words from Revelation: \"And There Came a Great Red Dragon Also\" ON THE LEDGER He flicks the pages of the large journal. The first item in the book, and the only one not neatly mounted: a yellowed photograph of a SMALL BOY with his GRANDMOTHER on the steps of a big house. The other pages contain articles about controlled hand. The musings of a man in torment. HANNIBAL'S EYES Move across the papers before him. DOLARHYDE Flicks to clean pages where he sticks a fresh clipping, and clipping (formatted in the same font and style as the \"HANNIBAL THE CANNIBAL\" headline we saw earlier) Headline: \"TOOTH FAIRY MASSACRES'PERFECT FAMILIES.'\" DOLARHYDE Uses a RED SHARPIE to scrub out the words \"Tooth Fairy.\" HANNIBAL HANNIBAL Looks up from the same article. CLOSE ON HANNIBAL Some time later, thinking. Composing in his mind as he sits at his table, a sheet of expensive paper before him. Then: CLOSE ON HANNIBAL'S HAND He holds a stick of charcoal. With it, he begins to write: \"Dear Will\" HANNIBAL EXT. MOOSEHEAD LAKE, ME - FISHING CABIN - DAY An achingly-beautiful view -- pine-forested hills surrounding a frozen lake beneath a vast blue sky softly painted with clouds.

WILL GRAHAM Comes INTO FRAME, bundled against the cold, but enjoying the air on his face as he repairs a fence. And then his face falls a little. He stands.

BUFFALO, NY - LEEDS HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT Will approaches the sliding-glass door from the backyard, trees crowding over the high back fence behind him. He notices an empty doghouse tucked away from the house. Will tucks his flashlight under his chin and scribbles on a pad from his pocket: \"Jack - where is the dog?\"  Will pulls a POLICE SEAL off the door and steps inside, into: INT. LEEDS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Quiet.  The only lights are blue pilot lights on the stove. Will is silent and still, just feeling the house. He crosses to the refrigerator and opens the door, bathing the room in pale light.

Then -- the thermostat CLICKS and the heat comes on. Will flinches.  He shuts the refrigerator door and turns on his flashlight, illuminating the empty room.

HANNIBAL RED STRINGS, reing blood spatter, stretch out from origin points, one in each bed (one on a boy's pillow, one on the floor near his bed), to the headboards, walls and floor, like strange spiny flowers. THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM As it passes over the strings and their origin points, the small balls on sticks become the DEAD LEEDS CHILDREN, but only with in the core of the flashlight beam, like a wormhole through time, lying as they were found and photographed. In the upstairs hallway, its shards shining brilliantly as Will plays the flashlight over them -- we just glimpse Will's face, fragmented in the shards, behind the flashlight's piercing reflection. His eyes blink out of sync. WILL'S POV -- THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY Follow the flashlight beam down the hall toward an ominously- open door at the end On the outer edges of the flashlight beam, we can make out BLOODSTAINS and DRAG MARKS on the floor.  A few RED STRINGS extending out from the bloodstains. THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM As with the dead boys, the small balls on sticks projecting strings of red become DEAD CHARLES LEEDS lying as he was found and photographed by the police. Finally, Will reaches that open door and enters the INT. LEEDS HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT Darkness.  Shapes of furniture. Glints of mirror shards. Ominous dark designs on the walls. Will's face again. Steely.  Finally, he flicks on the light, the switch smeared with blood and strands of Mr. Leeds's hair. RED STRINGS extend from multiple origin points (one stationary on the bed, one that rose from the bed and staggered away), turning the bedroom into a nightmarish, phantasmagoric forest of red tendrils. Because there is -- BLOOD EVERYWHERE -- splashed on the walls, the bed a mess of it, up the headboard and across the walls -- not like the elegant death tableaux we've known -- more Jackson Pollock than Raphael: jagged and jarring, insane.
