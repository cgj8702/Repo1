Uncomfortable to watch.\nForcing himselfinto superior condition.\nFinally, he releases the pose and stands slumped, shoulders\nrising and falling.

From elsewhere in the house.\nHe listens intently, very still.\nBut he hears nothing.\nCLOSE ON A TATTOO NEEDLE\nAs it is dipped and loaded with black ink. It is placed\nagainst pale skin and begins to PULSE in ULTRA SLO-MO. The\nneedle stabbing like an insect's stinger, as the unseen\ntattooist begins his work. Black ink and blood appear on the\nskin.  As the tattooist's finger wipes his work,\nFRANCIS DOLARHYDE\nStands now before an old, BROKEN FULL-LENGTH MIRROR and\nregards himself in the broken pieces.

Ng ng ggg.  T ttt.  S sss. Amid the fractured glass, his scar split by a crack a man in pieces. Then: The GROWL comes again. Dolarhyde's eyes jump. This time it is louder, closer. He looks around, confused. The NOISE comes a second time, fainter, before trailing off. He listens. Dread and awful curiosity in his eyes DOLARHYDE'S HAND Resting on the Formica table in the break room. An echo of the opening shot of his hand. HANNIBAL But now he's slowly opening and closing his hand, as if feeling new sensations. Sensing untapped power. REVERSE TO DOLARHYDE'S FACE As he regards his own hand with fear and awe Isolated from the DIM MURMUR of work conversations in the background. DOLARHYDE'S WORKTABLE The pieces of an old FILM CAMERA lie disassembled on the table. Dolarhyde's hands carefully polish a lens with a silk cloth. We are back in his attic room. His breathing is slow and shallow as he works, utterly focused. And then: The NOISE comes again -- far louder than before. Dolarhyde's hands freeze. He looks up with a sharp intake of breath. The NOISE, harsh and guttural, comes a second time, LOUDER. Insistent.  Primordial. It seems to be reverberating through the house, coming from many places at once. Seemingly filling his head and the house at the same time. Dolarhyde waits, his eyes wide with fear and anticipation. Slowly, his gaze turns to something in the far corner. We go into his POV to see: GRANDMOTHER'S DENTURES Snaggletoothed and yellowed. An old lady's dentures, resting in a dry glass, the water long since evaporated. PUSH IN on those dentures which VIBRATE ever so slightly, RATTLING in the glass as the NOISE comes again, building now, as if it is coming from the dentures themselves. And as it approaches a ROAR Meld the NOISE with a different BUZZING ROAR and -- A BLUR The tattoo needle is PULSING in and out of skin. Reds and blacks form into shading, a picture taking form HANNIBAL\""
